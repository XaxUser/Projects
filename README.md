These are some of my projects :
- Project 1 :  LLM-powered chatbot development and data extraction using different methods and evaluating the energy that demands. To provide
 practical insights, we will thus present a straightforward approach to estimate the energy consumption of an NVIDIA GPU during both the training and inference phases of a relatively
 simple neural network model.
- Project 2 : Python programs for face and emotions detection based on Deep Learning models

Stay tuned for more projects ðŸ˜‰
